roblox exploit thing that heavily depends on I/O stuff like writefile and readfile and isfile

# what it does:

for now, i have no idea at all but its supposed to replace your lua functions with
functions of luau except utilizing in better ways to not be detected by game cheats.

it also provides some snippet stuff and functions you can use in your projects
but in order to use it read the guide.

(still in production, wip)
